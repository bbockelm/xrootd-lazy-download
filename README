This XrdCl plugin provides a "lazy-download" mode for the Xrootd client.

All files opened are downloaded into a local temporary directory as part of
an unlinked temporary file.  As portions of the file are accessed, they are
cached locally in 64MB chunks; subsequent accesses will be served from local
disk / page cache instead of through the remote server.

This effectively implements latency-hiding for the duration of the file
processing, but does not cache across multiple runs.

As the files are unlinked, the disk space will be cleaned up automatically
if the XrdCl::File handle is closed (or the program crashes).

This plug-in forbids writes and assumes that the files are immutable.

Safety checks are included to make sure that the local disk space available
is at least N GB

Plugins are installed into /etc/xrootd/plugins.conf.d.  However, if you want
to test this from the build directory, you can run:

XRD_PLUGINCONFDIR=~/path/to/release_dir/etc/xrootd/client.plugins.d \
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/path/to/release_dir/lib64 \
  xrdcp root://foo.example.com/some/file /tmp/bar

TODO:
- Provide a "maximum disk space"; if the cached data goes above this level,
  punch a hole in the file.
- Have disk space usage be managed process-wide, not just per-file.
